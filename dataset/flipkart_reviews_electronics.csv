Packaging was really cute and open box delivery by delivery agent was a nice experience.

However HDMI arc is not available in S60, but other options like 3.5 mm audio in, COAX, and offcourse bluetooth works like charm. I have connected it to my 43 inch smart tv via bluetooth.

"I ordered this the moment it launched because I trust Mivi for MADE IN INDIA 🇮🇳 technology.
First of all I want it clear that this is NOT A BATTERY 🔋 BACKUP SOUNDBAR. It needs electricity ⚡️ for its running ( simple plug 🔌 is enough).
So if you are planning to use this for your travels and all, not for you.

Excellent Product I must say. The sound and bass quality doesn't feel like it's coming from a 3k sound bar(I got it for 2700 under a sale). You won't feel the need for an external woofer that's for sure and even other sounds are well balanced and don't distort even at Max volume. I am very satisfied with this product and definitely suggest it to others if you want to transform your TV sound quality. Good Product Mivi.,Great product,5
"I'm genuinely impressed by this product, Mivi really got this one nice. I have been using it as my daily driver and I'm genuinely happy by it's built and specially performance! It's loud and crisp at full volume and has good enough base. I found ""Music"" mode to be best for the pump and ""News"" mode if you want much lesser bass. Connectivity is pretty good as well although I would loved if they had feature to add multiple BT connections at the same time.
Rest assured, it's a pretty nice soundbar !",Simply awesome,5

After long search for soundbar Ends with Mivi Fort S100. I would say this is a premium soundbar at this rate. The sound quality is really good with good Bass effect.The in build subwoofer is well designed and produce right amount of Bass effect in the room.

I would say this product is better other Chinese products.,Perfect product!,5

Honest Review: I have a 55inch TV and i wanted to buy this speaker because the sound effects coming from the TV is not good. This speaker looked good and Bass is good. But it's not loud!! It should be around 40W to 50W. Not 100W for sure!! I contemplated for few hours and then decided to keep it as it serves the purpose. Movie mode is the loudest mode. So I am using it to watch literally everything. But I can't complain for the price i got 3299 which is okie.,Does the job,3

You should then go for some tws with vacuum grip.

Only good for listening music when it comes to calling you will surely disappoint by this airdopes.... Pathetic on video call ... You will be only able to listen noise not the sound of other person....

Cons:

Good bass and good battery🔋 😍,Best in the market!,5
Everything is best. The sound and bass is really good. It almost beats boat rugby in sound and bass. That's damn impressive given it's 5W compared to that of boat rugby which is 10W. Design is tough and soft both at the same time. There is just one problem. It takes 4 hours to charge. It gives 20+ hours playback which is damn impressive. But charging it for 4 straight hours can be irritating sometimes. Other than that each and everything is impressive.,Mind-blowing purchase,5

3) I didn't charged it even once and I listened to 15 hours of online classes and it stil shows 60 percent left. So battery back up is very very good.

I got it for 5.4k so first thing first at this price point it is one the finest headphone.
Sound quality is great as promised, noise cancelling gets the job done but could have been better, ambience aware mode is good
Design is decent.
For first few days you may experience ears getting warmed or full of sweat every 15-20 mins due to the cushion design.

The dark blue colour looks classy and the entire thing looks a bit bulky than the expensive Live 770 NC.
Regardless, it fits very well and being an over ear model the passive noise cancelling was very good.
A dedicated button for ANC/ Ambient aware works very well.
ANC is not 100% but for the price the quality of noise cancellation is phenomenal. Almost 70-80% environment noise is just tuned off. Mic quality is prett...

"The product was very goood with respect to Sound quality. And the design is just awesome. The battery backup will easily last more than a day if used for 16 hrs with the case.

The volume is amazing but I don't know if it will be enough in a party or something with people talking everywhere. For me this is the most value for money speaker available.",Must buy!,5

"Leta talk about thr sound because no one is here for anything else.

Personally it has a very crunched sound. If you are looking for high end sound it's not for them.
It has a minimal sound due to which you can play on full volume on full clarity on sound.
But the catch is it is not loud enough that's all you can expect from 5w speaker.
The build is awesome plasticky but it looks amazing.
Bass is ok not so deep but for the amount of money this speaker comes up its good.",Just okay,3

"They're seriously a steal at the price, packed with all the latest features. And the build quality? Top-notch! I've been using them for a few days now, and they're like music to my ears.The cushions on these headphones are so plush and luxurious, giving them a premium look and feel. And the fact that they're foldable is a game-changer when it comes to portability.
There's a little complaint with the left side being a bit shaky, that needed a little adjustment. But it seems like a minor hiccup...

"Being a user of Portronics products in the past, I had to give these earbuds a shot. And I'm not disappointed at all. For the price, it's an insanely brillant package especially the battery back-up which I didn't expect to be that good. I put it on charge just once upon receiving and after hours of usage daily, it still has enough to juice to keep up. That's insane. Sound and bass is good but not exceptional. Built quality of the case isn't top notch but then again, I ain't complaining at all...

I bought this in June-2013. It is almost a year. It works perfectly on power and under battery backup. The volume level is good enough. The reception quality is not great. But not too bad either. I do not want to comment time and again about Flipkart delivery which I think is already known to be a class,Good one,4

But the best part of this radio is that it has three different power modes,which is awesome.
Overall its a decent radio but could have been better considering the price specially.
Thank you",Decent radio but could have been better,4
"It is working well. As the name implies it has three power sources. AC, Builtin Battery and AA Cells. The builtin battery is pretty bad. Even after charging for 4 hours or so it does not last for more than 15 minutes. I mainly use it with pen cells. Clarity is very good. I recommend.",Philips FM Radio Trishul,4
I brought this for my mom. Even in ipad decade hearing radio always a sheer pleasure. Before buying this I searched all reliable online shopping sites and I am pretty sure you wont get this anywhere else at this price. Also the delivery is good with excellent tracking support The package was so nice and the radio has good sound in both battery and AC. The only negative thing is Flipcart took much time for delivery.

It is a neat little size. I bought it to listen to my FM channel. It is not super clear but with the aerial up it is reasonable.,cute,4
"I purchased it for Rs.750 and have been using it for 6 months. No complaints so far. works from all 3 types of power supply (1.5 v battery, internal battery, AC power) which makes it operational under all possible scenarios. tuning channel without a digital tuner and using an analogue one might be tricky for some but it have that oldie charm attached to it,once you get used to it, it's fine ..

Overall, a reliable product that is durable unlike some cheap Chinese digital radios",Pretty good product,4
"I bought this radio for my wife who wished it to be kept on kitchen cabinet and not required to go out to change channels every time in the system. This radio lives up 100% on that front.

It is a nice gadget and does all what is advertised. We prefer to hear FM only all the time so this works well for us. The sound quality is crisp and clear.

Build quality of case is 10/10. But the buds itself is kinda cheap looking (maybe because of glossy finish). Could've been way better if the buds also had rubber finish.

Battery backup is pretty accurate to the marketed numbers.

"Areas for Improvement:

1. Bluetooth Version: While Bluetooth 5.3 is present, the latest Bluetooth 5.4 would have been preferable.
2. Color Options: The current glossy finish on the case and buds is stylish, but offering a matte finish option alongside it would provide more variety for customers who prefer a less-reflective look. Realme could consider this for the Realme Air 7 Pro.
3. Lower Latency Desired: The previous Realme Buds Air 5 Pro achieved a 40ms low latency mode, surpassing the 55...

Stylish but a Fingerprint Magnet
The Realme Buds Air 6 Pro look great, with a sleek design and a glossy finish. They're lightweight and comfortable to wear for hours, which is important for me as I listen to music throughout my workday. The IP55 rating is a plus for my sweaty gym sessions. However, the glossy finish does attract fing...

"Have been using the samsung buds 2 pro and compared to them these are value for money under 4k.

They could have gone with the matte finish on the case for avoiding the scratches.

There is no option of volume controls in these although no other earbuds under 4k has that...

Pros:
1. The ENC worked well, it reduced 70% - 80% environment noise.
2. Call quality is also too good.
3. You can run a fitting test from the realme link app.

Cons:
1. Earbuds and case is too shiny, you can see the finger prints on it.

Note: As these earbuds have 2 drivers setup, so it might look bigger in ears as compared to single driver earbuds.",Simply awesome,5

"The features mentioned are exaggerated.

50 dB ANC is such a disappointment. The only thing it reduces is a ceiling fan noise not even a table fan noise.

360 spatial sound is a gimmick. Dolby Atmos works with any phone that supports it.

The battery on the buds charge to 100% really fast like 15-20 mins. But the case takes 2 hrs, that's not an issue.

The sound quality is good and the modification features like bass types and Equalizers are good but for normal use you can't keep them on f...

Do not buy this if you wish to save your hard earned money
Battery back up of this buds is just 3 hours if you use ANC+Ldac (On) for high quality sound

Realme does not mention this backup with Ldac while they have mentioned that it is compatible with buds but sadly they have not told that the battery back up is really poor just 3 hours with LDAC+ANC

Don't expect Dolby or DTS like sound at this price. But the overall sound quality is excellent. Useful for listening to music or videos from PC, laptop or mobile phone. Once fully charged, battery lasts for at least 6 days on average usage. Worth the price. Best budget speaker.
Best of all, it...

"This is an incredible soundbar i have ever seen. It's sound is superb. It can easily beat any home theatre sound system. I ordered this for my mother so that she can enjoy thr bhajans. But now it's rocking my room😁. I'm loving it. The best thing is it's battery backup, from the first day i haven't listened any battery low notification. I haven't expect this high level from MiVi. Now, I'm fan of this soundbar.",Classy product,5
A quite decent sound in this price range. Battery back up at 70-80% volume gives me around 6 hrs since last full charge. Despite this MIVI is madi in India product and also provides decent service in their service centres. Mivi fort s16 claims the cinematic sound experience feature and it feels by the vocals and trebles sounds like similarly as in theatre in this price range. If you are looking for a small sound bar for laptop/mobile and a normal living room for television you can go for it.❤️,Best in the market!,5

2 things to remember :-

1. if u r expecting good bass it's definitely not for u ... It's high trebles overshadows the bass ... if u bring the speakers really close to your ears u'll hear a bit otherwise u can say no bass at all ... Can't enjoy the bass in songs ...

One problem i faced when i m connecting from one to another device the sound becomes very low, than i hve to put it in the case. After doing this it becomes normal again.
May be this is with my buds only.

It's a perfect bomber product from FASTRACK.....I was using the OnePlus Buds Z2 before it....which has got the worst motion sensor...which is a very annoying thing.....but this product has just got everything into it.... Crystal clear voice on calls ..bass it just right and the thing that I liked most about it is it's GAMING MODE....because it has only 40ms latency which is just perfect to play games like BGMI .....overall it's a great one from the FASTRACK team,Simply awesome,5

"Genuine Review - 1. Bass is too much. I'm an bass lover but this much bass is not pleasant at all. Even equilizer can not suppress it's bass.. 2.

- The battery backup is really nice.
- No compatibility problems, however it doesn't support AAC sound attributes in some devices.
- One of my Pods has excellent bass, the other one's okay.
- Mono pod feature works well
- You can't control the volume with these, it has to be controlled by device you're connected to.

Probably the best you can get for 1300 INR",Wonderful,4

"Sound has good clarity but lack in bass. It has more of Mids and Highs. Lows will be a bit disappointing for music lovers who prefer good amount of bass. Overall build quality is quite good for the price. It fits well on the ears and does not fall on normal usage. Connection is also seamless and mostly automatic. It can pass through one wall. Had difficulty going through two walls though. Size of the earpods is fixed. Smaller or larger ears may face issue (my assumption only).

Pros:
1. Sound...

Today(02/10/2021) i bought this 5.1 Sound bar.

Surround satellite speaker cable very short I am disappointed only for this,my 10 years back previous f&d 5.1 f5060c home theater surround speaker cables very length.why such a branded zebronics company neglect the cable length surround speakers.my room only distance 14 feet.
Dolby digital Plus excellent from Netflix and hotstar x men series movies.",Great product,5
"I'm using this product 7 days only, and this is my review

Pros
1. Awesome sound, it will fill your 12x12 room easily.
2. Bass is heavy
3. Dolby works great
4. Great connectivity
5. vocals are clearly audible

Cons
1. satellites wire length is small

"I bought it in big billion sale the bass is really boooom , sound quality exilent , design is best ,in 10k it's good choice to buy worth zeb 9400, but can't beat Sony S20 ,sony has a melodious Sound a different level of sound quality,bass, trible, vocal. if ur budget is up to 20k then go for Sony s20. I have tested both physically.",Worth the money,4
"Bass is not so good. But still it is worth the money as I got it for 10k which is a good deal. Design is good. Wired connection nowadays are so annoying. So if you prefer wireless, then this model is not your choice. Side speakers wires are not so lengthy. So I was left with no choice but to keep it in front instead of rear. Overall if your budget is around 10k and you want to enjoy some decent sound quality, it's a go to choice",Delightful,4
What to say i thought this product wont play dts hd audio but this works perfectly through optical 5.1 dolby digital Dts and dolby digital plus works perfectly worth every penny ❤️,Value-for-money,4
its good in this range . i bought this at 10300 which he best at this range . sound quality is good .,Worth the money,4
"Dont know whether its my tvs issue ,When i tested 5.1 effect with a video from youtube rear speakers are not producing enough sound.Have to check with other tvs.Overall experince is good when i compared with previous sound system (sony 4.1) which lacks bass adjustment",Excellent,5
"Very very good product in this price range. Good bass,sound,connectivity and tru dolby digital Plus technology. Clear audio and bass is also good. I always want to listen this type of audio sistem. Better than i wish always.",Awesome,5

Delivery boy is good✅

I AM HAPPY WITH THIS PRODUCT ♥️♥️♥️",Wonderful,5
Nice product... Value for money.....bass is not so good...some connectivity problems....sound delay when connected with HDMI or optical input but it is negligible....Dolby digital+ output distorted when you change channels or change the output of TV Netflix/Prime Video/DTH.....good surround sound and Dolby digital+ experience in this price.....overall good product....,Value-for-money,4
"I like this product...but would have give some customisation for sound...and rear speakers wire is very less that couldn't fit for a rectangular room and all cables are very less in length..( aux cable, and rear speakers wire) atleast hdmi cable coul hv provided...please let us know the extra extension for rear speakers",Wonderful,4
The sound is good but the surround sound is not so great. The satellite speakers need to improve we can get less sound. We have tested with original dolby digital 5.1 test and rear Left and Right is not functioning well instead the rear satellite sound as per the test is giving output in front bar speakers. Expectation and reality is like expecting a BMW and you get Maruti car.,Decent product,3
Good quality of sound and bass.,Just okay,3
"Pros:-
1. Best 5.1 soundbar to enjoy movies
2. Good option within price range of 10K to 13K
3. Satellite speakers cable length is good enough for a 12ft X 12ft room

Cons:-
1. Audio latency( 1-2 sec audio delay when connected via Bluetooth)
2. Delivers Frequency of 50hz to 70hz even after completely reducing bass volume to -5 (bass that gives vibration effects) is kind of a disturbance for music lovers


Conclusion:-
Must buy if you want to enjoy movies,
Don't buy if you want to enjoy music",Delightful,4

"Zebronics 5.1 has been a terrific product. I had twin towers from Zebronics in the past, so I had some experience in my rebuy.

You get dolby digital feel. But yes, play a good quality audio or video. The hall in which I am using it 18 by 14. But in more compact area it will be amazing.

Was not sure about it but when I installed it and hung the satellite speakers I felt the effects. This is provided you are on HDMI arc and watching a movie file which is 5.1 Dolby recorded.....else you can use the default equalizer button on the remote which will do the trick.,Value-for-money,4
out Standing performance by zebronics sound bar Dolby digital Plus it has everything to get very crystal clear optimum sound and I feel like that it is compete to much expensive other brands sound system it has very digital balance bass and treble also it fhas produce very Dolby digital sound like a theatre and it has a very responsive performance very creative products for very reasonable price thanks Flipkart to provide me those who want Dolby digital experience,Classy product,5

"Awesome... Totally satisfied, This is best in this price range I would say, sound quality is superb.. I Strongly suggest use high speed HDMI cable with TV for best experience, it will surely give Dolby experience. Bluetooth, Pen drive and Aux also works well.. Thanks Flipkart and Zebronics3",Brilliant,5
This is a very good product to be considered. Thumping bass . I felt sometime vocal is missing for the heavy bass. If it has dedicated bass control in remote. i expected upward firing speakers but thery are all front ficed. But overall sound is truly good. Settelite wires come short in length 19 inches. but in my opening there is no need these settelite speakers as they have very low sound. Soundbar and sub woofer made my purpose solved. a recommended product.,Good choice,4
"Bass is not enough and not punchy, sound clarity is good , 5.1 works well, u feel dolby sounds with sharp why because Dolby sounds have some sharpness , while playing music on BT mode suddenly disconnects and again connects with low volume",Good,3
Waste of money too much problem s,Nice product,4
The remote can be made in better quality in terms of performance and control the customise Equalizer not works good . And bluetooth connection disconnected some times . And wire length is not enough . But still I gave 5 star because it is a budget soundbar and giving very fantastic audio when connected through arc cable in Dolby digital Plus mode,Terrific purchase,5

"The company's claim is true ... it has killer bass and the kills other sounds ! The thumping bass suppresses the treble and vocal sound. Sometime vocal only audio gets distorted by enhanced bass. Recently the trend of super bass inclusion is killing the beauty of music.

However, the call quality is exceptionally good ! Receiving end person doesn't get any unwanted sound occurring around you. ENC works perfectly. You wouldn't find such a neckband than can handle ENC like this one.

Comfort - Guys, It hurts Ear walls, feels bulky. I removed the ear hook because it was too bulky and then i came to know why it was given!

"The company's claim is true ... it has killer bass and the kills other sounds ! The thumping bass suppresses the treble and vocal sound. Sometime vocal only audio gets distorted by enhanced bass. Recently the trend of super bass inclusion is killing the beauty of music. However, the call quality is exceptionally good ! Receiving end person doesn't get any unwanted sound occurring around you. ENC works perfectly. You wouldn't find such a neckband than can handle ENC like this one. The wire is ...

"The neckband serves its purpose adequately and is worth the investment. However, there are a few drawbacks worth mentioning. Despite being connected, it tends to disconnect intermittently, which is frustrating. On a positive note, the sound quality is good, and the backup charging feature, while not excellent, is satisfactory.

💢2-Build quality 2 ⭐/5 , it doesn't have cable protector at the end like shown, quality is not that good, magnets are also 3/5 ⭐
💢3-📉No eartips - inspite of giving that high quality Plastic Frame, unwanted cable that nobody uses etc,they could add eartips in this Price

Pros👍📈-

The frequency distribution graph of these is very balanced which means that these deliver the same quality sound as it was intended by the production house and the artists themselves.

Surprisingly it fits well too. Found best in this range very satisfied 👍.,Fabulous!,5

"I went for this instead of the much cheaper Boat, Noise and other buds popular in the Indian market only for one reason. And that is sound quality. After using Sennheiser for 5 years, none of these other cheaper headphones and buds could impress me. All they had was excessive base and they end up distorting the real sound.

But Sony does what it has been doing best since the good old days of Walkman. Precise and excellent sound quality with added Equalizer options for people to set the sound...

"Writing this after one month of usage; Overall this model is a good product, the main selling point is the battery, i've use them daily for about 7 hours and they last 5-7 days without charging.

PROS;

Build quality is above average, dropped it a couple of times but no damage.

Sound quality is 8.5/10 I'd say, lacks bass but still good.

Connectivity range is awesome, good while you have your device in a close by range.

Battery is superb, better than most of the Airdopes I've tried.

Sound quality: Average sound quality. Bass boosted but sound quality degrades in lower frequencies.

Loudness: Pretty loud. 25% volume is loud enough for indoors listening. Hardly used over 50% volume.

Noise isolation: Decent.

Fit: Excellent.

Battery: Hats off. Charge it, forget it.

Connectivity: Excellent. Signal drops rarely even after 2 walls.

Mic: No complaints.

Built quality: Below average. Pretty sure the charging port is going to break first. C...

The mic does have noise cancellation and quality of voice over mic is very good.

The bass is deep and punchy but above 80% volume level the highs starts distorting and it feels really bad...you can't control bass of the subwoofer....you can control only sound bar's bass and treble (I have mivi fort s60 too and it's without subwoofer and the quality of the soundbar is better than s250) overall if you use this in 60-70% volume you will not be disappointed..O got it for 5999 snd its value for money,Pretty good,4

Loving it",Highly recommended,5
"Noise cancellation is best in the class. Conversation awareness is most useful feature when using ANC. Sound quality has improved a lot (4 out of 5 now) compared to Gen 1 Airpods Pro but it can be better, especially the dynamic EQ algorithm which user does not have control. The EQ is more focused on vocals than the instruments playing in the background.

For Apple users this is the best TWS they can buy and there is no competition when it comes to the ecosystem integration.",Must buy!,5

First I will tell you this is really good for the price. If you download the 'Nothing X' app for audio customization. U can enhance bass as per your choice. But the bass is really deep and sound quality is well balanced. Still u r in dilemma then go for Realme wireless 3. For full details u can check YT Madhu Mini Tech,Highly recommended,5

"I had been using Oppo Enco M32 before this purchase.Have been using the neckband for about 15 days
Compared to enco this one is not that great.
The only add on i felt is ANC.
Sound quality is poor.
Ears will pain after just 45mins of usage.And i tried using different eartips they provided.
The dial thing is so cool.. But if you move you shoulders, hand it'll rotate and sound will burst into you ears.",Not good,2

In default mode, its configured with ANC in High and ultra bass ON

Please do yourself a favor and install nothing x app in your phone and change the mode to treble and turn off ultrabass.
You'll still be left with plenty of bass but it will not sound muddy anymore.

I use it for running in the mornings with transparency mode.

BATTERY - Battery backup is sufficient. Will last you more than a day on heavy usage.

CMF by nothing is one of the best neckband I ever used. As compared to One plus bullet Z2 and Realme wireless 3. All 3 has a almost similar sound but with the help of application you can adjust bass in Nothing neckband and Realme neckband. Using since 6 months without facing any problem. ANC is much better than One plus and Realme wireless 3.,Wonderful,5

Sound quality: The audio quality is outstanding. The bass is deep, and the mids and highs are crisp, offering an immersive listening experience.

Battery life: The 30-hour battery life is fantastic. I can use these earphones for days without worrying about recharging.

Fast charging: The fast charging feature is a lifesaver. A quick 10-minute charge provides hours of playback.

These are very loud which is very annoying as there is no balance, bass is also not balanced tried different settings but result is same every time.

ANC - 3/5 - for this price range it's good but if you want good ANC then go for OPPO ENCO 2 PRO / REALME BUDS 3
sound - 4.5/5- the sound is really nice and clear even in the 70% volume. As the drivers are 12.5mm u cannot hear in the full sound for sure. But if u do hear it then u are either u born with super powers or deaf.
Build - 4/5 - overall build quality is good and as it's manufactured in china i won't give 5/5 coz i have lot of trust on china products 😂😂...

But the call quality of realme buds q2 was very bad. So I purchased these for calls and it was decent.
No one complained about my voice quality.
Options were little less.

But the sound quality is great
Vocals and mids are good. Volume is huge and bass is little low but I could sense the surround effects due to Dolby Atmos support. Overall am satisfied with oppo",Good choice,4

"Let's start with the good thing first: the sound quality. It's an 8/10. In the original sound quality mode the bass is almost unavailable in most songs. So if you like to hear good bass as well, you have to change the mode to bass mode. Then it produces really good bass, but the rest of the sound becomes a little off in bass mode. So, I normally use the original mode with a 3rd party equalizer bass turned on. There is one other mode called voice mode or something which I never used.

- main thing is that the RGB light is taking more charge it's obvious.
- and the case charging time is more than 2hrs.
- while using both buds at a time some time it's getting one-sided. Like in one side is louder than the other.
Over-all it's better according to price range of 1100 but when it's 1500 and above then don't go for it
- dual connectivity is fine but somehow it's unstable",Nice,3

Advantages ;
1. Design and plastic material is good, neither so premium nor so cheap but fall in medium look. Ear plug design is innovative.
2. So responsive buttons.
3. Battery backup was so good.

3. After 70% volume distorted sound could be experienced.",Fair,3

If you are finding a budget headphone for Movies & PUBG then .. Go for it.... 3D sound experience through PUBG, MX player & Netflix is Good.

"I ordered this the moment it launched because I trust Mivi for MADE IN INDIA 🇮🇳 technology.
First of all I want it clear that this is NOT A BATTERY 🔋 BACKUP SOUNDBAR. It needs electricity ⚡️ for its running ( simple plug 🔌 is enough).
So if you are planning to use this for your travels and all, not for you.

Excellent Product I must say. The sound and bass quality doesn't feel like it's coming from a 3k sound bar(I got it for 2700 under a sale). You won't feel the need for an external woofer that's for sure and even other sounds are well balanced and don't distort even at Max volume. I am very satisfied with this product and definitely suggest it to others if you want to transform your TV sound quality. Good Product Mivi.,Simply awesome,5
"I'm genuinely impressed by this product, Mivi really got this one nice. I have been using it as my daily driver and I'm genuinely happy by it's built and specially performance! It's loud and crisp at full volume and has good enough base. I found ""Music"" mode to be best for the pump and ""News"" mode if you want much lesser bass. Connectivity is pretty good as well although I would loved if they had feature to add multiple BT connections at the same time.
Rest assured, it's a pretty nice soundbar !",Just wow!,5

"Sounds gets zzz.... after 80% volume. Bass and sound output is super high. As the main body is made of plastic(not super high quality), built quality and premium feel is not that good compare to mi earphone (700rs). Realme one has better sound cancellation. Mi one is softer and well balanced sound but realme one has 20% over loud sound (bass both similar). Really if u wana buy realme one go for black one.",Simply awesome,5
"Very niceproduct and the base of the product is well I will give it to 4 stars because sometimes the sound quality of the videos or any music is not good and the base is similar to that song on the front of the pack is it is written that feel the real bass and at last the product is very good without thinking you can purchase this product from Flipkart the delivery is very fast and the product is very good .
Thanks to Flipkart.",Terrific,5
"The quality of the earphone is very good it may comepete with the earphones which are about 1500 rs to 2000 rs the bass and treble are so nice but due to bass the vocals may affected a little but in your day to day usage you don't feel but those who are bass lovers like me the absolutely prefer this earphone

Its a Signature sound by Realme India..

"The sound and bass are really good. Bass is really powerful. After 2 weeks of use the pin end is somewhat broken from the inside. Seems wont last for more than 1-2 months at most. But all the other parts looks better built. I have very rough use and i keep my headset in a pouch. Not worth 600, flipkart smartbuy headphones are better but not much rich in sound like this one.",Fair,3
"Bass is awesome, a little extra, so people who like bass will love this, I personally like a balanced sound signature, so bass can be turned down just a notch, but treble is waaaayyy too high. It really ruins the experience, it hurts my ears. Mids are pretty good. Build quality is decent. Too much treble ruins the sound quality, that's why 3 stars. If treble was balanced then would have given it 4 or even 5 maybe.",Good choice,4

"This is best handsfree for gaming and listing song. I also play pubg india and other games it's best for all. It has 3D voice system.
So this is best for gaming.",Great product,5
"Ok so lemme start from the basics, the Earphones are comfortable, if I'd have to guess then I'd say that it cancels out around 80-90% of the noise around you.

The Pros: this is gonna be mutual traits, the bass on this is CHONKERS and I mean it, they are comfortable to wear, not to mention the magnets on the top of the ear pieces, they are quite clicky too.

Cons: None as of now, I do wanna point out that for some the bass might be a little over the top.

Now after purchasing realme buds 2 I can say my 600rs was well spent & it has better sound quality than boat 225 hands down the base is punchy & thumping, those 11.2mm drivers are working excellent, probably this is the 225 killer.

"For me the main attraction is the build quality. The main cable is very durable. Although I don't know about the joints. It would've been super if the Y split cables were braided too. Now, the sound quality could've been better. Bass is muddy which overpowers mids and highs. Although because it has a higher volume than other similar earphones the highs are very shrill if you listen to full volume. But I know most of average Indians who are looking for a budget earphone will most certainly lov...

However, the call quality is exceptionally good ! Receiving end person doesn't get any unwanted sound occurring around you. ENC works perfectly. You wouldn't find such a neckband than can handle ENC like this one.

After using Boat Airdopes 402 got this pair of Airdopes 131 PRO. Design and build quality is top notch but Sound quality could have been better. Like in Airdopes 402 i could not go full volume from my phone it was that loud and clear at the same time. But in Airdopes 131 i have to go max volume to enjoy loud music. It felt like something is missing but the bass covers it up for you. I would say it's a decent but.,Really Nice,4

"It's been 4 days since I started using these buds.
Design and build quality seems ok for the price as I bought it for 1299.
Battery backup is also almost same as mentioned and it depends on volume and beast mode we use.
Coming to sound quality, it is ok. But loudness could be more better. You have to use minimum of 70-80% of volume in most times for clear listening.
And Calling quality is nice, it cancelling out surrounding noise and only my audio is transmitted to the other person in call....

"I have used the product for a week and these are things i noticed.

Pros: The sound is good, base is punchy and overall better sounding than most of the mid range ear buds.
Call quality is good .

Cons: When you straight up use the buds while charging you can feel the heat near the connectors.
sometimes the connectivity is poor , hoping the will fix it with software updates. battery backup is not good as they claim.",Just okay,3
"In comparison of other buds , battery backup of this buds is very low.",Decent product,5
"Genuine Feedback Alert!

Sound and connectivity is awesome.
Bass also good.
Size - perfectly compact.

Only negative thing is not good calling experience.
ANC not properly working.
If you talk seating in train then also 85% background noise will come and your voice will hardly captured.

Overall good.

If you are buying for calling then I'll not suggest you.",Highly recommended,5
"Sound quality : all good
ANC : it cancel fan and some sound which is less 45 db
Bass : neutral
Connectivity Range : 7m to 8m, it can't pass a wall,
Battery : 20 hours
Some times touch panel are not working properly, Some time while enjoying music breaks.",Terrific,4
"Reviewing after 15days of usage, The sound quality is good, but you will be getting lag and disconnection issues if you play music and keep the mobile in your pocket. You can't even use it for calls if you keep your mobile in your pocket. To get a perfect sound quality, you have to keep your mobile in-hand always.

I am not happy, because we use Buds for hands free operation, for this product you don't expect hands free operation.",Very Good,4
"Best in these segment
Just for it",Very Good,4
"Really good in this budget. Definitely reached expectations. The best part is the software, so intuitive and easy to use. Design is very neat. Eye pleasing. Comfortable in ears. Used it for hours without any discomfort. Sound quality is good enough. Bass is really good. Call quality especially mic was too good. Opposite person was able to hear my voice clearly even in heavy Bangalore traffic. Noise cancellation is pretty average so dont keep high expectations. Overall a solid 4/5",Pretty good,5

"It is a good product. Everything works well not too good not too bad, but calling is not that much good like any other TWS at this price range.

Good build and quality. Nice noise isolation. Still have to test it for battery life,Terrific purchase,2
"Purchased this costly piece only because of noise cancellation feature.
But got embarrassed during office calls as every other noise is getting picked even in noise cancellation mode.
The noise suppressing is only that you will not hear outside noise while the other person on the call can hear everything at your end.
This is even more unwanted thing
i usually purchase 700 rs earphones from other brands and they work fine.
Nothing diluting the brand. I will no more go with nothing products.",Not good,5

"First will talk about the issues:
1) When turned on, it by default goes into Bluetooth mode. This may be a issue if used with TV, every time you turn on the TV, you have to select AUX input.
2) The turn on/off or mode selection voice is way too loud.
3) The woofer output is good , sometimes there is bass to voice, which makes it very difficult in movies ( this does not get sorted even on changing modes )

This wireless costs for 2k and the sound quality is way much better than the JBL E25bt earphones, trust me the bass vocal are top notch according to the pricing of the earphones. In 2k you will have features like waterproof, low latency mode (only for OP users), magnetic control (which I am loving it) easy pairing and quick switch (also loving the most) and the main feature of working for 10hours o...

"Bass is less as compared to other earphones. Also, sound quality is not as good as expected. Sound is like surrounded & feels like theatrical sound.

But it's still decent for this price, extremely good for calls. using it for over a month now and haven't faced any issue yet with calling. Go for it if your budget is this much.

Actually, the sound is also good as too high bass in in-ear headphones pains & damages the ears.

So, a thumbs up from my side!",Delightful,4

"I have used this with a non OnePlus device so take that into consideration when reading this. Just want to mention that if you are not an audiophile you will never notice the difference between AAC and aptx. These earphones only support AAC and SBC.

Cons:
The bass is very much lacking. The treble at higher volumes sometimes (although rarely) starts tearing up. If you are interested in movies with a lot of explosions and bullets flying around it won't be a very immersive experience.

Since I have many calls/meetings throughout the day, I needed a headset with good battery backup (was fed up of my ANT headset as it used to run out of battery midway through the day), something which is comfortable and flexible enough to use in a rough manner.


Why I believe this is just perfect for my needs-

"161 pro buds. Brought this at 999. At this price it is totally worthy. Shiny case, chances of getting scratches with the time. Build quality is decent of buds as well as case. Compact size easy to carry in your pockets. Though case size is small but the battery backup is quite impressive. Balanced sound output. Base, vocal and instruments sound can be heard clearly. Boat signature sound which always impress. For 999 dual pearing is just amazing. Satisfied with the purchase.",Highly recommended,5

Sount quality It awesome...Sound is very loud and trust me i had used many earphone ...many means I can't even count. ..But i found the bass is the best in this earphones ...But clearity is somewhere lacking here...for pubg or gaming i would say that they will help you but they aren't the best ...for gaming i would highly recommend JBL c150SI. Blindly go for them you won't regret ...and sound is also awesome in JBL ..",Simply awesome,5
"My brother said don't purchase online you will get duplicate earphones & said me to purchase at showroom.
* But I checked full reviews

*When it comes to SONY durability and Sound matters
* Sound quality is good but advice able to listen in low volume",Super!,5

I bought it 4 years ago and am still using it.,Just wow!,5
"In starting I was not satisfied with the sound but when I started experimenting with EQ then I realised the power of these mini powerhouse, using it with galaxy S8 which supports upto 32Bit/380KHz studio quality audio output and Dolby atmos and what a performance , deep bass and theater effect. If you wanna listen more crisp mids and treble you can reduce Bass from your device otherwise Mids and Treble are smooth with fullon Bass atleast for me. Must buy, must experience🙂",Simply awesome,5

"why Sony Has done Like this I don't understand. I'm using XB50AP from past 2years it's very clear and each n every Musical sound is crystal clear having Excellent Bass effects. So when I have plugged in XB55AP I felt the clarity is not as clear as XB50AP and also Bass was too much dominating the Clarity. I was expecting This would give more Excellent sound quality output. But little Bit Disappointed only compared to XB50AP only. But the best in class compared to any other Earphones in this p...

"As expected totally bass oriented, and that trait sometimes muffles the voices and instruments beats. The only pros is that it has inbuilt mic and a well built premium looking body. So bottom line, recommended for bass lovers and gamers....but audiophile audiences might not like it that much as the audio quality is bit on the muffled side.",Nice,3
Good bass and build quality..,Great product,5
"If you have a budget of 2k, and you prefer wired earphones over the wireless ones, this is one of the best you can get. The ear pieces may look heavy, but they are very light. A friend of mine actually wore it and danced all around his rooftop to see whether it falls off or not, and guess what, it didn't.
Sound and build is totally worth the money!",Fabulous!,5

Pros:
