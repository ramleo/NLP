"Thank you Flipkart by making the purchase hassle free and providing a better price than most brick and mortar Apple resellers/retailers. It's not a huge jump over the iPhone13 but the size of the screen and features, especially if you're coming from anything less than a 13 is significant. And the battery life is phenomenal. I'm simply amazed with over 10-12hrs SoT and battery life easily extending to over 2 days on a single full charge.","Awesome, as expected",5.0

Also, if you scroll slowly, you feel like 60hz is not 60hz at all. Probably might get fixed by software updates.

Apart from these two, it's a good phone but feature wise, not a big jump from 6a.

The camera is a little bit better than the 6a.

Why I choose this phone is only because of the Brand value.We have more other options like Vivo T1 ,Realme 9,9pro , Oppo ,Motorola.
But the OnePlus has their own premium feel
The reason why I have given only 4 star:-
1-The AMOLED display is not there.But it is not important.
2- Wide angle lens is also not there.
3- They have removed Alert slider.

Other wise the phone is perfect. I am satisfied with this device 95%.

Reviewing after 45 days of usage.Firstly the size of the phone is so perfect that it easily gets adjusted in your palms and easy for day to day use. Camera and performance is absolutely smooth and top notch. Except for battery (As my job makes me to call and receive approx 150 calls daily) which gives me 12 hrs backup (However on Holidays backup goes upto 20hrs) Phone is a must buy and the best creations of Google.

"I upgraded from iPhone 7 Plus, So it a bigger and better screen with smaller form factor ratio. I miss touch id specially in pandemic time but face id solves the purpose most of the time. I bought 128GB variant and the difference from 64GB and 255GB is -10k and +10k which means apple is charging too much for 64GB storage, that means its not value for money exactly.. However buying a 64GB variant is a trap as you will need to keep on deleting data only.",Awesome,5.0
product is amazing but the experience with flipkart is very bad. I had mentioned GST no of my company at the time of placing the order but there was no gst no mentioned in the invoice. numerous mails and complaints lodged but they refused to provide me GST invoice.,Just wow!,5.0

I have bought iPhone as i have been gifted with airpods and now apple watch. So taking about the pros are it has superb screen and camera is way to awesome. I feel UI is better than andriod phone and Siri helps a lot. Cons would be battery backup is not good as compared to andriod phones. Also I bought it for 67999 which is indeed a good amount. Also it only has one sim so you cant use two sim like android. So its upto you to decide which suits you more and buy accordingly.,Super!,5.0

Major disappointment - CAMERA GOES BLURRY when you try to focus in very CLOSE RANGE.
I have checked online and it seems the issue known to everyone.
It seems the Iphone 13 does not focus at all at close range because iphone pro and pro max have Macro feature in the camera (When you take camera very closer to an object, it zooms in and gives you more detail). SERIOUSLY??? Why do you have to remove the focus or make the camera blurry?

iPhone heats a lot because of its built. Its frame is steel and the back is glass but it has great things when it gets hot, it restricts some features to cool it down.

I purchased this for my wife for the reason one very well understand. I personally using S-22 ultra so I don't find i-phone as compatible and user friendly as other Android phones. Camera and Video quality may be good but with little difference as compared to other premium Android phones. Data transfer from Android to i-phone is not at all easy as claimed by Apple.

Fast charging works but battery could have been atleast 4500/5000 MaH since the size of the phone is big.

Been using this phone for two weeks now. The main highlight of the pixel 8 phone is the camera. To be honest it is undeniably stunning and takes high quality shots especially the night sight. The photo features are amazing. The phone doesn't heat that much as compared to pixel 7 when using the camera app for a longer time, but doesn't necessarily mean it's fixed. Apart from that, there aren't any major lags while using the phone. The display is very nice at 2400 nits peak ...

"After using it for a month, I'd say it's a pretty decent phone.

Camera = Decent, I'd say 4/5. Sometimes it takes good photos, sometimes it just doesn't.

Battery = Easily lasts a day with regular usage, I'm usually left with around 50% battery at the end of the day. It easily gives you about 7-8 hours of screen time, which is not a problem since charging time is much faster, a 15-20 minutes of charging can last you the whole day with mild use like calls, messages and social media.

Can’t move forward without saying this. Battery of this phone is a life saver when I am traveling or at work when I don’t get the option to charge

Price as all know , bit high. My first iPhone but well satisfied with the product. Charging speed by the in-box dispensed charger is substandard.

The package came packed perfectly. The box was sealed which gave me a big relief.

Apple needs no introduction since its the dominant market player. I just love the way how IPhone 11 stands out so boldly. The moment I took it out from the box, I could feel the premium intensity. The body is remarkable and crafted for giving you a elite vibe.

"Ok, so after almost 3 years I am again back into Apple Ecosystem. Switching from Android to iOS has just one disadvantage imo, and that's you can't take your WhatsApp data restored to iOS. Everything starts fresh, pretty sad. I am so glad that I chose iPhone 11 over 12. With 5G nowhere in India for at least an year will have an added advantage to iPhone 11. Spending extra 25k just for A14 chipset and OLED display is not a clever choice. Anyways, a fantastic phone with everything fit perfectly...

Now coming to the phone, it's nothing short of amazing. It was a pretty easy transition but that may be because of the fact that I still have an android lying around when I need it.

First of all had a little doubt if the phone would be genuine, but i did a thorough check after receiving it. Everything was fine, and its an Indian model for those who are curious about it.
I would suggest you to buy the device from flipkart instead of buying it from apple authorised stores, this would save you more than ten thousand .

Anyways Great device! Great performance! ...

The iPhone 14 Pro Max Delivers Unparalleled Excellence - i I got the 512GB ROM variant.

Review:
I recently upgraded to the iPhone 14 Pro Max, and I must say, this device is a game-changer. From the moment I held it in my hands, I could tell that Apple had once again pushed the boundaries of smartphone technology. With its sleek design, stunning display, and an array of impressive features, the iPhone 14 Pro Max has exceeded my expectations in every way.

"I think there is much hype created for the camera and the dynamic island. If I talk about camera, I have gotten better images with iPhone 13 in comparison to iPhone 14 Pro Max.

Design and build is damn good for sure. Display is crisp and clear. Feels premium when you hold it. But it is heavy, so could feel a lot of weight in your hands.

Sound is great with the onboard speakers. It is loud and clear. However if you want to feel bass do use a headphone or AirPods.",Very Good,4.0

"Some might find camera portraits to be oversharpened, which is actually a deal breaker in some cases but in most cases it actually helps. Battery degrades fast if operated at 120hz refresh rate.

"I upgraded or I will say downgraded from OnePlus 7 Pro to this pixel 7 Pro with a higher amount. This phone doesn't have volte calling support in India. I will say India users shouldn't buy this phone. None of the smartest features that they advertise are available in India. OnePlus users shouldn't move the stock to Android experience, no customization lots of small small things that we use we will miss all on this phone.

This has to be the best flagship device under Rs. 1L budget. The QHD+ display is crisp, have slight curves on the edges. Dont expect too much curve like other devices. The 120hz display is smooth, glides smoothly. Have no lag or frame drop. The more Im using the phone, the more Im into it. Bit heavy device (around 210g). Initially when I was using the device, it was getting bit warm below the camera bump, also during charging it was getting warm...

The battery is not able to last even 1 day without heavy usage and also dark mode + battery saver at 50%. The camera itself takes a lot of power to process the photos.

Coming back to design, fingerprints at the bank glass so cover is mandatory and due to curved screen it accommodates dust and hard to find good tempered glass",Nice,3.0

"Overall good experience (4 months review)

Display : 60hz but impressive,

Camera: if lighting condition is good then it can click very good photos but incase of poor lighting not good experience at such price point.

Battery: It can give 5-6 hr of screentime, it can sustain whole day with single charge.but Battery health reduces 1% in my 4 months of usage which is quite shocking for me.

Charging: Charging speed is quite good with 20w charger but at such price point it could be better.

"First and foremost, the Product Red variant is absolutely gorgeous. The vibrant red colour not only makes a bold statement but also supports a noble cause, as a portion of the proceeds goes to the Global Fund to fight AIDS. Sleek and stunning design. iPhone 14 also exhibits remarkable speed and responsiveness, thanks to its powerful A16 Bionic chip. Whether I'm multitasking or playing graphics-intensive games, the phone handles everything effortlessly.

The camera performance is, as expected...

"Camera and Display are good. Battery lasts for one day for medium usage. Overall Apple is good in hardware. Moving from Android hence taking time to get used to iOS. Some features in Android are better like swipe on side to move back, notifications swipe down from anywhere in the screen instead in iOS have to go all the way to top and swipe down to pull notifications. For now Android user experience is better. Don't know if it will change after getting used to iOS.",Wonderful,5.0

"Not a great phone. It's just a decent branded phone.

The form factor is super amazing. it feels good in hand and that's it. That's all I can praise about this phone.

The biggest issue is the fingerprint scanner. It's pretty inaccurate, doesn't work half of the time. And if you've installed a tempered glass forget about using the fingerprint scanner. It just stops working.

I'd used OnePlus 7T for 3 years before switching to Pixel 7 and I'm missing the super fast fingerprint scanner, fast ...

"Honest review -

Phone is good for parents who are new to smartphone.

Wifi connection strength is low. You have to be in closer proximity to the router in comparison to other phones.

Camera is not good. Don't expect much.

On call volume is low. You have to put on speaker

Good sides -
Battery is good.
Phone is decently fast
Display is big

Overall average. But for the cost this is one of the good phones that you can find.",Good,3.0

Writing after 4 days of use. According to 6 Gb ram phones it is working slow and lag can also be seen. Games is not working up to the point. Game stuck in between. If you have to buy for normal use you can go for it but remember phone doesn't have capacity for heavy use. In fact in normal use it's also lagging. Battery backup is average approx 12 hrs ( based on normal use).,Fair,3.0

No one can give you the specs at this price point. I would suggest to use with samsung chargers only.,Fair,3.0

6. 128 gb base variant.
7. 2 year android updates and android 13 out of the box.

Cons:-
1. Notch display and thick bezels. Doesn't look like a modern phone.
2. Performance is not good. I have installed normal day to day applications and I saw many jitters an...

"I already hesitated to buy this model, yet i bought out of a blind expectations. Because i already own an M32, and very very worst performance. You can't even use the mobile, it just hangs a lot and tests your patience to the core.
Yet i bought this another samsung F series hoping that would do better, but disappointed. Same performance. It hangs a lot. According to me, all the samsung models below 20,000 are just garbage. Redmi is the real budget king.",Just okay,3.0

First overheating problem - while video calling it is overheating within 10 minutes. I tried two alternate days and found overheating issues. Even I had to disconnect my video call due to it.
Secondly it's mic sound is very low that one can't probably make a call in crowded place .

Display, colours, contrast is perfect..if you are willing to buy a phone for media consumption you can easily go for it. It has a support of widevine L1 so streaming high quality videos and movies can be done without any problem..It supports AR games too. On playing BGMI and COD phone does not heat up immediately but it heats up slowly. There is no crashing of games on high graph...

"I will get straight to the review.

What is good?
1. Display, 2. Design (Minimalist), 3. Build Quality

What is bad and needs improvement?
1. Performance - There is lag. Even when switching between different apps. My guess is One UI skin is very heavy which is causing this issue.
2. Camera - Samsung has to improve the quality using image processing which they can do with updates.
3. Due to above reasons, only time will tell whether this device would be able to handle 4+5 years of updates.",Good,3.0

"I gave a 1-star rating not due to the phone itself, but because of the absence of a charger. It is frustrating that companies do not include chargers even with budget phones. This is a consistent problem I encountered, as even when I purchased the S21 FE previously, a charger was not provided. It is a serious issue that needs attention from the appropriate authorities to address. The lack of a charger with the phone purchase is becoming an increasingly common practice in the industry, impacti...

"Pros:
The haptics are good
Performance is decent enough
Storage is on point
Multimedia is awesome with very good speakers and awesome display( Kudos Poco)
Main Camera is decent,like it does the job.

Cons:
Mind you that it does not have any vapour cooling system and hence the phone is slightly overheating while gaming and charging.
This display is dolby vision HDR and still does not get HDR playback support.
It has a motion based proximity sensor so it can cause a mess while taking calls....
